                This is a webpage I made with Glitch!  April 2021.

                <p>
                My name is Allison, I'm about 5'6", medium witted, human. I'm omniovorous
                and semi-nocturnal with a proclivity for adventure, and a penchant for
                trying to use words that I may not actually know.
                </p>
                <p>
                I have a very large dog. I also have a birthday coming up. For my birthday
                I've asked my friends to go camping with me and get me drunk.
                </p>
                <p>
                I aspire to have a cabin in the woods someday, with a small garden, and
                perhaps a creek. I also aspire to learn how to tailor clothing and explore
                light carpentry as hobbies down the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                I enjoy hammocks, hiking, sandwiches, banter, and puzzles, among other
                things. I spend most of my freetime kickin' it with my friends and
                housemates, and procrastinating about cleaning my room, folding laundry,
                or more trifling things like updating my vehicle's registration.
                </p>
                <p>
                I also enjoy playing music. I play things with strings, mostly guitar when
                by myself. I play mandolin and viola in a small band with some buddies and we have a
                good time even if no one will ever hear our stuff, which would be
                alright with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                When I grow up, I hope to be strong, healthy, and well rested.
                </p>
